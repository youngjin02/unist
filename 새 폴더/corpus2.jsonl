Acquisitions\nTrillium\nOn November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage immuno-oncology company developing\ntherapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a price of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash\nacquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trilliums lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational\nfusion protein that is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, which exclude cash\nacquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired IPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of\nwhich the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired\nprimarily consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.\nArray\nOn July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule\nmedicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of\ncash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense\nand recorded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash."}

As such, the forecasted annual income tax charge on the U.S. non-GAAP adjustments is calculated using the statutory tax rate of \n24.5%. There is no forecasted annual income tax benefit for Mexico non-GAAP items, as there is no forecasted annual tax expense on the income in the calculation of GAAP income tax expense.\n \nOur non-GAAP operating income rates decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to unfavorable SG&A rates, partially \noffset by favorable gross profit rates.\n \nOur non-GAAP effective tax rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters. Our non-\nGAAP effective tax rate increased in the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters and decreased tax \nbenefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by the impact of lower pre-tax earnings.\n \nOur non-GAAP diluted EPS decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the decreases in non-GAAP operating income.\n \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \nWe closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. Our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment required to support \nour business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, dividends, credit facilities, short-term borrowing arrangements and working capital \nmanagement. We modify our approach to managing these variables as changes in our operating environment arise. For example, capital expenditures and share \nrepurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy, which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other \nchanges in our business environment. We have a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our strategy.\n \nCash and cash equivalents were as follows ($ in millions):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJuly 29, 2023\n \nJanuary 28, 2023\n \nJuly 30, 2022\nCash and cash equivalents\n \n $\n 1,093 $\n 1,874 $\n 840"}
